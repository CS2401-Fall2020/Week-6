# Week 6

Given an array of Strings, use merge sort (as described in class) to sort the strings in order of **increasing length**.

You should use the code we developed in class on [September 23rd](https://github.com/CS2401-Fall2020/September23-inClass).

Do not change the method signatures. **Do not use helper methods**.
